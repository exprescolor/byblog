# Maximum Score From Removing Stones

You are playing a solitaire game with **three piles** of stones of sizes `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. Each turn you choose two **different non-empty** piles, take one stone from each, and add `1` point to your score. The game stops when there are **fewer than two non-empty** piles (meaning there are no more available moves).

Given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, return *the* ***maximum\*** ***score** you can get.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = 2, b = 4, c = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The starting state is (2, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 6 points.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = 4, b = 4, c = 6
Output: 7
Explanation: The starting state is (4, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
- Take from 1st and 2nd piles, state is now (3, 3, 6)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (2, 3, 5)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 3, 4)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 7 points.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: a = 1, b = 8, c = 8
Output: 8
Explanation: One optimal set of moves is to take from the 2nd and 3rd piles for 8 turns until they are empty.
After that, there are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= a, b, c <= 105`





### My solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int res = 0;
    int maximumScore(int a, int b, int c) {
        // find the min & max pile
        int _min = INT_MAX, _max = INT_MIN, _mid;
        int min_index, max_index, mid_index;
        int ar[3];
        ar[0] = a;
        ar[1] = b;
        ar[2] = c;
        for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
            if(_min > ar[i]){
                _min = ar[i];
                min_index = i;
            }
            if(_max < ar[i]){
                _max = ar[i];
                max_index = i; 
            }
        }
        if(max_index == min_index){
            min_index = 0;
            max_index = 2;
        }
        mid_index = 3 - min_index - max_index;
        
        if(ar[max_index] == 0 || ar[mid_index] == 0 ){
            return res;
        }
        ar[mid_index] --;
        ar[max_index] --;
        res = maximumScore(ar[0], ar[1], ar[2]) + 1;
        return res;
        
    }
};
```







### Better solution

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumScore(int a, int b, int c) {
			int res = 0;
      vector<int>arr = {a, b, c};
      sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
      for(; arr[1] != 0; res++){
        arr[1]--;
        arr[2]--;
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
      }
      return res;
    }
};
```
