You are given an undirected graph. You are given an integer `n` which is the number of nodes in the graph and an array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between `ui` and `vi`.

A **connected trio** is a set of **three** nodes where there is an edge between **every** pair of them.

The **degree of a connected trio** is the number of edges where one endpoint is in the trio, and the other is not.

Return *the **minimum** degree of a connected trio in the graph, or* `-1` *if the graph has no connected trios.*

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/26/trios1.png)

```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[3,2],[4,1],[5,2],[3,6]]
Output: 3
Explanation: There is exactly one trio, which is [1,2,3]. The edges that form its degree are bolded in the figure above.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/26/trios2.png)

```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[1,3],[4,1],[4,3],[2,5],[5,6],[6,7],[7,5],[2,6]]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are exactly three trios:
1) [1,4,3] with degree 0.
2) [2,5,6] with degree 2.
3) [5,6,7] with degree 2.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 400`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n-1) / 2`
- `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
- `ui != vi`
- There are no repeated edges.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minTrioDegree(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int res = INT_MAX;
        vector<vector<bool>> g(n+1, vector<bool>(n+1, false));
        vector<int> degree(n+1, 0);
        
        for(vector<int> e : edges){
            g[e[0]][e[1]] = true;
            g[e[1]][e[0]] = true;
            degree[e[0]]++;
            degree[e[1]]++;
        }
        for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++){
            int d_i = degree[i] - 2;
            if(d_i < 0)
                continue;
            for(int j = i+1; j <= n; j++){
                if(g[i][j] == false)
                    continue;
                int d_j = degree[j] - 2;
                if(d_j < 0)
                    continue;
                for(int k = j +1; k <= n; k++){
                    if(g[i][k] == false || g[j][k] == false)
                        continue;
                    int d_k = degree[k] - 2;
                    if(d_k < 0)
                        continue;
                    res = min(res, d_i + d_j + d_k);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return res == INT_MAX? -1:res;
    }
};
