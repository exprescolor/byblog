> gcc (GNU Compiler Collection)包括了C，C++ , java , go语言的前端。也包括了这些语言的库（如libstdc++、libgcj等等）。GCC的初衷是为GNU操作系统专门编写的一款编译器。开发商Free Software Foundation。GNU通用公共许可证（GNU GPL）。前端的功能在于产生一个可让后端处理之语法树。

> Arithmetic and logical unit ALU as name suggest does all the arithmetic and logical computations. ALU performs the operations like addition, subtraction. ALU consists of logic circuitry or logic gates which performs these operations.

> Register is a small set of place where the data can be stored. A register is a combination of **latches**. **Latches** `门闩` also known as **flip-flops** `触发器` are combinations of **logic gates** which stores 1 bit of information.

> CPU has registers to store the data of output. Sending to main memory(RAM) would be slow as it is the intermediate data. This data is send to other register which is connected by a **BUS**. A register can store instruction, output data, storage address or any kind of data.

> Ram is a collection of register arranged and compact together in an optimized way so that it can store a higher number of data. RAM(Random Access Memory) are volatile and it’s data get’s lost when we turn off the power. As RAM is a collection of register to read/write data a RAM takes input of 8bit address, data input for the actual data to be stored and finally read and write enabler which works as it is for the latches.
