MISQ的Editor-in-chief Paulo B. Goes对如何做design science research和写design science paper的评论摘抄。

## Should a Design Science paper connect with a theory like most paper in social science research?
In design science research, the main concern is not to test or create new theories, although the constructs and methods that are created can lead to these. Rather, the main objective is to create knowledge through meaningful solutions that survive rigorous validations through proof of concept, proof of use, and proof of value. Therefore, it is absolutely not a requirement of successful design science manuscripts to have an explicit tie to theory.

## How to prove Design Science paper's rigorous?
The rigor in design science research must be pursued in the methods employed in the development of the artifact and the methods employed in the validation of the artifact/solution.

## Publication schema of design science paper
1. Introduction with precise articulation of purpose and scope of the artifact.
2. Literature review section with relevant descriptive knowledge and prior prescritptive knowledge. Notice that this section may not refer to any theories if the descriptive and prescritptive knowledge bases do not include them. Or the theory tie may be presented in a circumstantial fashion, since the purpose of the artifact is not theory testing.
3. Method section where research rigor is fundamental.
4. Artifact description.
5. Evaluation.
6. Discussion and conclusion.
