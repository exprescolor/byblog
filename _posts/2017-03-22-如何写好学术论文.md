最近收到了博士的入学通知，于是笔者终于要在下半年成为一个IS的PhD Student了。
最近导师也给我布置了很多学习任务，比如学习如何写学术论文。在这里稍微记录一下。

## Get An Idea
首先是想到一个你感兴趣，又有研究价值的topic。
好的research topic必须是：
- propose a new idea;
- contribute to solve an important problem in an domain;
- not over-studied, and avoid horse racing situation.

好的research topic一般从两种途径来：
- 现实当中遇到的问题，一般从大量实践中来；
- 最近的学术研究热点，一般从大量阅读中来。

## Before Starting
不管是idea从哪来，在开始正式分析数据/写报告之前，都要好好数理一下自己的idea，compare解决类似的问题的paper，然后列一个"Pitching Research"的table。
了解什么是“Pitching Research” 看[这里](https://www.business.uq.edu.au/supplementary-material-pitching-research)

然后和导师/同学商量和讨论这个问题的研究价值和研究方法。
几轮modify以后，就可以开始写作了。

## check box
写完以后，对照一下以下编辑关注的“做”和“不做”的边界，看看自己的文章还能在什么程度上改善。

### Yes to Do 
1. It provides insight into an important issue
2. The insight is useful to people who make decisions
3. The insight is used to develop a framework or theory
4. The insight stimulates new, important questions
5. The methods used to explore the issue are appropriate
6. The methods used are applied rigorously and explain why and how the data support the conclusions
7. Connections to prior work in the field or from other fields are made
8. The article tells a good story

### No to Avoid 
1. It fails the technical screening
    - The article contains elements that are suspected to be plagiarized, or it is currently under review at another journal. (Republishing articles or parts of articles, submitting to one or more journals at the same time or using text or images without permission is not allowed. See our ethical guidelines.)
    - The manuscript is not complete; it may be lacking key elements such as the title, authors, affiliations, keywords, main text, references and all tables and figures).
    - The English is not sufficient for the peer review process,
    - The figures are not complete or are not clear enough to read.
    - The article does not conform to the Guide for Authors for the journal it is submitted to.
    - References are incomplete or very old.
2. It does not fall within the (journal's) Aims and Scope
3. It's incomplete
4. The procedures and/or analysis of the data is seen to be defective
5. The conclusions cannot be justified on the basis of the rest of the paper
6. It's is simply a small extension of a different paper, often from the same authors
7. It's incomprehensible
8. It's boring
